### Client Files

You will also need to download a client. [Download the game client](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VtnTcGivQ1P89bocQTO1LkwCDB4hvx8A/view?usp=sharing)

## Setting up the Game Server 

* Download and Install Hades  [Download](https://github.com/wren11/Dark-Ages-Private-Server/releases/tag/e121eac) \(Release\) 
* Download both [database.zip](https://github.com/wren11/Dark-Ages-Private-Server/releases/download/e121eac/database.zip) And [Lorule.GameServer.zip](https://github.com/wren11/Dark-Ages-Private-Server/releases/download/e121eac/Lorule.GameServer.zip) from the project's **GitHub** Page [here.](https://github.com/wren11/Dark-Ages-Private-Server/releases/tag/e121eac) 
* Install all Prerequisites in the table above, for "**Running the Server**"  
* Extract all contents of database.zip and Lorule.GameServer.zip somewhere on your computer that will be the host computer \(most likely this will be the computer you are using now\) 
* navigate to where you extracted the Lorule.GameServer.zip archive and browse the folder and find the configuration file. it is called `LoruleConfig.json` 
* Open the configuration file in some type of text editor, i recommend Notepad++ [Download](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.8.8/) if you have not got a handy text editor yet. Notepad shipped with windows will do, but we all know it's garbage! 
* Modify the `LoruleConfig.json` file with the path's inside the **`locales`** section. below is a part of the configuration file that you must edit correctly. and when editing this file. **you must use double slashes** for path **`\\`** separators.  do not use any single **`\`** backslash in this configuration file for any paths.  
* Modify the configuration file inside the Locales section, you will see two properties and i will explain each in the next section below.

### Server Configuration

 **"Content" Section**

**Configuration - "Editor" Section**

### Running the Game Server

* Navigate to the folder ![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)
* Double click on the file ![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)
* The game server should now be started. if you are prompted by windows firewall, click allow.
* You should now see a running console and it should look like this \(as shown below\)

## Setting up the Game Client

So you should be up and running now with the game server and you now you probably want to connect to your running server, to achieve this, you should need to use a client. so let's start with what you will need.

### Game Client

You will need a supported Client to connect to the Game Server.

#### Download Dark Ages Client 7.18

Below you can download the client is 6 parts, Alternatively if you rather, you can download the entire thing  
that is [available here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VtnTcGivQ1P89bocQTO1LkwCDB4hvx8A/view?usp=sharing) \(google drive\)

### Installing the Game Client

once the client is installed, and extracted to your computer. You should be able to see the following contents inside \(as shown below\)

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2811%29.png)

### **Client Not Connecting?**

The **Hades.exe** client has been **hard-coded** and it will allow you to   
connect to `localhost` also known as `127.0.0.1`  
  
if when you setup the IP Address in the **LoruleConfig.json** file, if you have modified it to not use **`127.0.0.1`** and instead used your **`public IP Address`**, then it should work with both, but if it does not connect, then i assume you have **NOT** or incorrect setup **NAT forwarding.**  
  
if you have not setup NAT forwarding, then it's best to set the IPAddress in the config file to **127.0.0.1**  
until you have done so**.**

## Router Configuration

* First, open the windows `cmd` terminal and type `/ipconfig`
* look for the active `eth` adapter in use. an example of what mine looks like below is show below

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

* Find the correct `IPv4` Address, this will be important, as you can see above. Mine is _192.168.1.110_ so whatever yours is, is going to be your INTERNAL IP when setting up NAT forwarding. 
* open a browser and connect to your default gateway Address, as above mine is _192.168.1.1_  **\(yours will likely be different\)** 
* Look for a section called **NAT Forwarding**, or **Port Fowarding** or **Virtual Servers**, the terminology will be different from device to device, so you will have to work this out yourself from here, but somewhere in there will be a place with a similar looking table like the one shown below

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

* Add in your IPv4 Address you found using **`/ipconfig`**
* Set External and Internal Ports to **2610** - **2615**
* Set the Protocol to **TCP** or both **TCP** or **UPD** if that's the only option in there.
* type into google "what is my ip" and update the LoruleConfig.json and set the IPAddress to your IP Address that google tells you. \(Your Public IP Address\)
* you should not have the router setup to allow you to connect to yourself, from your Public IP, others to connect to you, and vise versa.
* if you have trouble setting this up, Feel free to seek help on the[ project discord ](https://discord.gg/QayQFJY)
